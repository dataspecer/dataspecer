# Dialogs

Another way to interact with concepts than [visualization](./visualization.md) is to use dialogs. There are different versions of dialogs based on what they do.

You can open them either by clicking action buttons in [model catalog](models.md#buttons), [concept catalog](concepts-catalog.md#action-buttons) or in the [context menus](./visualization.md#context-menus) in visualization.

Dialogs are mostly divided into three parts.

1. header with base information

-   source model of a concept, its color
-   language selection
-   concept name

2. additional fields

-   (input) fields for modification

3. and action buttons

-   confirm
-   add
-   cancel

## Detail Dialog

Show concept's detailed information.

Header contains the most important information - name, source model, iri, link to open up the concept in its location `üìë`, its generalizations (parents) and specializations (children).

Mid-part shows concept's type, description, attributes (for classes and class profiles), domain and range (for relationships and attributes).

### Click-through-s

In the detail dialog, generalizations/specializations, attributes or domain/range are clickable elements, they look like `üüß My class 2`. When you click on it, it will show you the detail of the concept.

## Modification Dialog

## Profile Dialog

## Create Class Dialog

## Create Connection Dialog

## Add Model Dialog

You paste the urls of your models you want to use to the textarea of the dialog. You can add multiple models at once but be aware that they get interpreted as if it was a single model. Confirm adding the model by clicking `‚úÖadd` or cancel by clicking `‚ùåcancel` button.
