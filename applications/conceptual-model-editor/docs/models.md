# Model catalog

As you might've deduced, here you manage the models.
You have the list of models and some buttons.

## List of models

Each row relates to one model. Models can be added with the [buttons](#buttons) below.

Row starts with an icon. Each model type has a different one.

-   local `üè†`: instance of a local model. You can add concepts here, you can modify its [base IRI](#changing-the-base-iri) and add profiles of concepts from other models.
-   sgov `sgov`: instance of [slovn√≠k.gov.cz](https://data.gov.cz/datov%C3%A9-sady)
-   rdfs `üìÅ`: instance of a model from `.ttl` file published somewhere on the web. _Just be warned, we have not yet optimized for large models such as schema.org_

Hovering over the icon shows you the type of the model. With local model, you will also see its [base IRI](#changing-the-base-iri).

Remove the model from workspace by clicking the `üóë` button.

### Aliasing a model

We reference models with `id`s. We understand it is not the best fit for you, so you can alias the models by clicking the `‚úè` button on the right side of model row.

Simply type in the alias and hit `enter` or click elsewhere. If you don't want to use the new alias, hit `esc` and the alias will remain unchanged.

### Changing the base IRI

It is beneficial to have a base IRI set for your models/vocabularies. With local models, you can set their `base IRI` by clicking the `üìë` button right next to the model icon.

It works the same way as model aliasing. Type in something, confirm it with `enter` or click elsewhere, cancel it with `esc`.

## Buttons

The bottom part has 3 buttons, one to add any `.ttl` model, one for `local` model and a shortcut for [slovn√≠k.gov.cz](https://data.gov.cz/datov%C3%A9-sady).
