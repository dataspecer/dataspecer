# Making your work persistent

You should start in the [Specification manager](https://tool.dataspecer.com/manager) where you create:

-   your own directory (package)
-   in there a visual model
-   open the visual model in CME

Once you are in `dscme` you can play with your models and profiles. To save your work to the dataspecer backend:

-   **once**: click the `ðŸ’¾pkg` button in the central part of app header
-   **once and leave**: click the `ðŸ’¾pkg & ðŸ‘‹` button in the central part of app header
    -   it will take you back to the [Specification manager](https://tool.dataspecer.com/manager)
-   **automatically**: click the `ðŸŸ¢autosave` button in the right part of the app header
    -   it will sync your modeling state to the backend every _15s (based on current configuration)_
    -   you'll get notified that the autosave happened by `...saved ðŸ¤ž` message in the button

## Take it to your own hands

You can also generate your model to lightweight owl ontology, export your beautiful diagrams or export your current workspace. For more information, refer yourself to [exports section](./exports.md).
