# Testing

Since `dscme` is more about UI, there is not that much to be tested.
If you are writing some util functions, you can take an inspiration in `/tests/*-utils.spec.ts`.
Other functionalities rely on taking some data, processing them and displaying them in the UI.
Cypress or other tool might be a good fit for the job but i didn't have the time or energy to make it work.
