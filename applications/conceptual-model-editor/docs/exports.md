# Exporting

## Exporting Lightweight ontology

By clicking `ðŸ’¾lw-onto`, we'll generate a lightweight ontology based on the [Semic style guide](https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/index.html).

We currently support only base concepts -- classes, relationships, attributes. Profiles are to come(?).

## Exporting your workspace to json

You can also export (`ðŸ’¾ws`) your current `dscme` workspace to `.json` and use it afterwards by loading it to `dscme` with `ðŸ“¥ws`. Just be informed that we now support only playing with your workspace afterwards. Saving it to backend is not supported.

## Exporting the diagram on canvas

It can happen that you modeled something beautiful (we believe in you). Now you want to show your friends. You can export what's on your current canvas by clicking `ðŸ–¼` button that is in the top right corner of your canvas.

(_disclaimer: It is there because the developer did not find a way to make the button work elsewhere. In the future, we aim to make this button be part of the export buttons group in the header._)
