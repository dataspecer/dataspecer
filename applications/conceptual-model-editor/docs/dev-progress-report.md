    -   in the end - reactflow
    -   even though it has some drawbacks such as edge renderings, no edge layout customization
-   8-12/2023
    -   dataspecer/core-v2 came up
    -   application had to be reintegrated
    -   first connection to dataspecer backend, saving stuff
    -   concept manipulation - crud
    -   using reactflow and core-v2 EO 2023
    -   model colors
    -   visual models / views - impl for dataspecer/core-v2 pkg
    -   multiple views support
-   01/2024
    -   class boxes on the canvas have attributes
    -   edges on canvas have colors, labels and cardinalities
    -   central view management
    -   dialogs
        -   create model
        -   create relationship
        -   modify concept
    -   saving whole workspace to backend
-   02/2024
    -   rendering edges with existing ends
    -   view management for canvas
    -   local project/package manager
    -   enhancements on backend service
        -   listing views
        -   adding color support for models
    -   opening package from backend with `package-id` query parameter
    -   detail dialog shows attributes + cardinalities
-   03/2024
    -   visualization does only partial updates, no full rerenders
        -   subscribes to aggregator changes
    -   an attempt at auto-layout, too difficult
        -   (5/2024) another student now works solely on layouts
    -   random names generation
    -   color picker instead of completely free color picking
    -   support for opening a view directly with `view-id` query parameter
    -   internal change of naming profiles instead of usages
    -   start of work on application profiles
    -   language setting works even in visualization
-   04/2024
    -   hierarchical view on concepts and their profiles in concepts catalog
    -   `dscme` has first users
        -   first datasets modelled in `dscme` for other students -- LLM assistant
    -   auto-generation of iris based on names
    -   unifying dialog looks
    -   new class on `alt`+click on canvas
    -   model aliases
    -   default local model after cold start
    -   using the same colors in a new view
    -   support for profiling, showing values of profiled concept
    -   **the second half of april**
    -   let's start over
    -   we have to work with edges differently than before
        -   reverse engineering was wrong, the whole group had to come with a way of representing relationships and attributes
    -   rewriting relationships and attributes to the new style
    -   dataspecer/core-v2 wasn't even ready for that, had to do some impl there too
    -   util functions to distinguish relationships and attributes
    -   adjustments on lw-onto generator for the new approach
    -   i feel the time-crunch, new requirement still piling up
    -   util functions getting the name/description/.. easier
    -   model base iris
    -   showing generalizations/specializations in the detail dialog
    -   context menus on canvas
    -   aggregator didn't show profile info properly
        -   now it has the [`raw` values](./dev-docs-working-with-aggregator.md#with-raws)
    -   don't just take whatever profiled class had, take only what's necessary
        -   override checkbox
    -   domain and range can come in any order, we have to support that as well
-   05/2024
    -   profiles also need iris
    -   support for absolute and relative iris
    -   file structure refactor
    -   data-types support, easily extendable
    -   absolute iris for built-in lw-onto generator
        -   works well only within `dscme`, backend lw generator doesn't use the information about source model
    -   dialog buttons unification
    -   entityProxy for easier detail info reading
    -   drag-n-drop
    -   autosave to backend
    -   more refactoring, self-closing picker and context menus
    -   request to postpone the deadline
    -   started the documentation
    -   üëÅ/üï∂ changing the state only when needed
    -   fixing failed pipelines because some students push directly to main
    -   integration to the manager app / built-in project manager, based on the deployment
    -   dialog provider
    -   generalizations were done only for classes, the interface didn't say it worked otherwise
        -   adding that functionality
        -   labels for edge generalizations on canvas
        -   modification dialog now adds generalizations
    -   feedback for `üíæpkg` button
    -   package and view query params are now part of `useQueryParams` hook
    -   maybe something else, you can check the git history
-   06/2024
    -   conditionally defended
        -   documentation was supposed to be lacking
    -   improved documentation
        -   added Dataspecer(?) motivation
        -   described the architecture diagram and mapped it to dev and user docs
