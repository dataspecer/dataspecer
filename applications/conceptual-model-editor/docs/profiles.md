# Profiling

You can create a profile of any concept type except of generalization. To do so, you'll have to click the `ðŸ§²` / `ðŸ§² create profile` button from [concept catalog](./concepts-catalog.md#action-buttons) or from [visualization context menu](./visualization.md#context-menus) to open up the [profile dialog](./dialogs.md#profile-dialog).

You can create profiles that are of the same type, `class --> class profile`, `relationship --> relationship profile` but no `class -/-> relationship profile`.

By default, you just edit the profile's iri, we try to help you by copying the original iri and appending `-profile` at the end.

If you want to change anything else, you have to check the `[ ] change in profile` checkbox. Other than that, profiling is very close to modification. For more information on how to use the input fields, go [here](./modifications.md#input-components).
