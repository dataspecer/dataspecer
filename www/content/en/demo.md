Please be aware that any changes made in the demo may be removed at any time. Also, please do not interact with others' work. Create your data specifications.

{{< alert icon="⚠️" text="Keep in mind that the tool is still under development. Some things may be buggy, not work at all, or can be hardcoded for now." />}}

### Brief tutorial

1. Create a specification.
2. Choose a source for a conceptual model at the bottom of the page with the detail of your specification.
3. Create a new data structure.
4. Insert a root element by searching its name.
5. Insert child elements by clicking on the plus sign next to the element, and edit existing elements.
6. Generate a single artifact directly from the editor page or go to the detail and generate everything.

### What to try

If you decide to use slovník.gov.cz as the conceptual model source, you can search, for example:
- Tourist destination
- Natural Person
- Thing

You can try our demo RDF vocabularies which are read directly from GitHub. This feature is experimental and currently very slow.
