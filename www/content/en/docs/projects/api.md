# Introduction

The project "Expanding the Dataspecer Tool for API Creation and
Management" was developed within the scope of class Research Project
(NPRG070) at Charles University in Prague. This report serves the
purpose of providing a comprehensive overview and analysis of the
project. To be more precise, the report begins with the motivation for
the project. Next the report provides user stories to comprehend the
essence of the end-user requirements. Conversely, it proceeds by
describing and showcasing how the program works. Lastly, the report
takes a closer look in the code and provides information regarding the
system design and key technical decisions.

# Motivation

Dataspecer represents a tool which is being developed at the faculty of
Mathematics and Physics of Charles University. It serves the purpose of
managing as well as modeling data structures. Conversely, it automates
different types of tasks with respect to data schemas. Despite the fact
that the capabilities of Dataspecer are extremely advanced, there are
directions in which the tool could be expanded. My motivation of
pursuing this project was exactly the fact that the tool did not support
the process of API creation and management -- more precisely generation
of API specification and its maintenance. Nowadays, APIs represent a
pivotal part of the tech industry. According to CISCO, Internet of
Everything (IoE) represents a networked connection of four units. These
units are: people, process, data and things \[1\]. APIs on the other
hand represent the point of connection between products and services
which means that they allow aforementioned four units to communicate
with one another \[1\]. Given their crucial role in enabling seamless
interaction as well as integration across various platforms, the
relevance of the APIs cannot be overstated. Conversely, when we talk
about API creation and management in the context of this project, we
specifically refer to the generation of API specifications (in OpenAPI
format) and their maintenance. By developing the feature of creating API
specifications and maintaining them, the expanded version of Dataspecer
can significantly streamline the development process, ensuring that APIs
remain up-to-date and are fully functional as data structures and
requirements evolve. This expansion not only enhances the tool\'s
utility but also aligns it with the current demands of the tech
industry, where efficient API management is essential for the
development of various systems.

# 1 Exploring User Perspectives through User stories

In any research project it is paramount to understand the needs and
aspirations of the end-users. The aim of this chapter is to capture the
essence of the user requirements by providing following user stories:

1.  I as an API designer who already works with the Dataspecer tool want
    to generate API specification based on the artifacts (data
    structures) designed in Dataspecer, so that I am able to utilize the
    same tool not only for data modeling but also for creating
    respective API specifications.

2.  I as an API designer want to generate API specifications in OpenAPI
    format so that my APIs are compliant with the industry formats.

3.  I as an API designer want to customize certain fields of my API
    specifications so that I can meet specific client requirements.

4.  I as an API designer want to go back to my latest saved
    configuration so that I can ensure consistency in the API design
    process.

5.  I as an API designer want to receive suggestions about paths
    (endpoints) so that my design process is simpler.

6.  I as an API designer want to design operations not only for the data
    structures on the main level, but also for the data structures that
    are one level below, so that I can ensure granular control and
    organization of API endpoints.

7.  I as an API designer want to choose if I am manipulating a
    collection or creating an operation just for a single resource so
    that I can design APIs that cater to variety of use cases.

8.  I as an API designer want to be restricted in submitting the same
    operation name to multiple different operations, so that I can
    maintain clarity and avoid ambiguity in the API specification,
    ensuring that the developers are able to interpret the generated API
    endpoints accurately.

9.  I as an API designer want to be restricted in submitting two same
    operation types to one path (endpoint), so that I can enforce
    consistency and adherence to API design practices.

10. I as an API designer want to download JSON representation of
    generated API specification from my designer tool, so that I can
    share it with stakeholders and team members easily.

11. I as an API designer want to copy the generated API specification
    with a button from my designer tool, so that I can transfer it to
    different documents or emails in a timely manner.

12. I as an API designer want to open Swagger Editor with a button in my
    designer tool so that I can utilize its graphical interface.

# 2 Key Conceptual Decisions

At first Dataspecer was analyzed. Handling data specifications
consisting of different data structures represents a standout feature of
the tool. More precisely, the tool has access to various conceptual
models and the user is able to design specific data structures based on
those conceptual models within the data specification. Because of this
standout feature, it was decided to utilize a resource-oriented approach
whilst developing the project. Based on the analysis, Dataspecer is
highly compatible with the concepts of RESTful APIs. To be more precise,
when it comes to REST APIs, fundamental concept is resource \[2\]. More
precisely, a resource represents an object that has a type, associated
data, relationships to other resources as well as a collection of
operations performing different manipulations on it \[2\]. On one hand
data structures designed via Dataspecer have a type, attributes and
associations however the information regarding the set of methods
operating on them is not available in the tool. Therefore, when it came
to mapping the concept of resources from RESTful APIs to the data
structures designed via Dataspecer it was crucial to obtain information
about the aforementioned operations. In the context of this project,
this means that in order to be able to generate API specifications
corresponding to the data specifications, the information regarding the
methods operating on data structures (within the data specification)
need to be obtained. Because of this, desired information is specified
by the user in the new extension and is utilized for project purposes --
API creation and management, more precisely generation of API
specifications and their maintenance.

Data Structures designed in Dataspecer may have multiple levels.
However, in the context of API generation it is logical to create
operations for main data structure and data structures which are one
level below it. Going beyond this level of nesting would make the form
overly complex and difficult for users to comprehend the core
functionality of the operations. Moreover, operations beyond the second
level are considered often redundant since they tend to be too granular.
This means that they would acomplicate the interface without providing
significant additional value. Because of this, one of the key conceptual
designs made within the scope of this project was to limit the
operations to the first two levels which ensures clarity as well as
usability of the program.

As mentioned above, a resource-oriented approach was employed for
project development. OpenAPI standard was chosen as the format of
developed API specifications since OpenAPI standard (OAS) defines a
standard representing a language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs
\[3\]. OAS enables both humans as well as machines to explore and
understand the functionalities of the service even in the absence of
source code, documentation, or the need for network traffic examination
\[3\].

In order to provide further clarification regarding key conceptual
decisions, it is essential to consider why AsyncAPI was not chosen as a
format for generating API specifications. As said, Dataspecer and its
capabilities were analyzed thoroughly. The analysis made it evident that
data structures designed via Dataspecer are highly compatible with the
principles of REST, which in turn seamlessly aligns with the OpenAPI
standard. Initially, it might have seemed that OpenAPI and AsyncAPI
would be similar. However, they not only serve different purposes but
also support distinct communication protocols.

The main focus of AsyncAPI is Event-Driven Architecture (EDA). In
event-driven architecture the main emphasis is on events. In EDA events
are utilized for triggering and communicating between different services
that are decoupled \[4\]. In this context, event is a state change or
even an update -- for instance, an item being added to a shopping cart
on an e-commerce website. To be more precise, events either contain
state or act as identifiers \[4\].

Current version of Dataspecer does not provide information regarding
events, which would be prerequisite for creating specifications in
AsyncAPI format. Conversely, the effort needed to develop such
specifications would be disproportionately high compared to the benefits
given the current capabilities of the tool. Based on this information,
the decision of adopting the OpenAPI standard was made which better
aligns with the resource-oriented approach and data structures which are
supported by Dataspecer.

# 3 Functionalities and Operation

Now that motivation for the project as well as key conceptual decisions
are already considered the functionality as well as operation of the
developed program may be discussed. As mentioned, the program generates
API specification in OAS based on data specification created via
Dataspecer. Because of this, the quality of the generated OpenAPI
specification highly depends on the quality of the data specification
which is taken as input by the program. Please note that the program
assumes **unique names of the data structures**. This section will
demonstrate the working process of the extension based on an example
data specification called "Sample Data Specification". This data
specification consists of two data structures. These data structures
are: Tourist Destination and Member. Please refer to Pic 3.1 and Pic 3.2
in order to view the representation of aforementioned data structures.

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image2.png" %}}
*Pic 3.1 -- Representation of Data Structure "Tourist Destination"*

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image3.png" %}}
*Pic 3.2 -- Representation of Data Structure "Member"*

## 3.1 Accessing the extension -- API creation and management 

Now that the input data structures are already presented, the actual
extension may be discussed.\
Before moving on to the actual program, it has to be noted that the
Dataspecer tool is equipped with a manager (currently in development)
which may be accessed via following url:
<https://tool.dataspecer.com/manager/> . In order to generate OAS the
user has to access the Dataspecer manager and find desired data
specification. Once the data specification is found a plus button on the
right side needs to be clicked and the manager will display various
options. OpenAPI Specification represents one of the proposed options.
Once the user clicks on OpenAPI specification option, he/she will be
asked to create a name and description for the package. Please refer to
Pic 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 below in order to view the steps needed for creating
OAS package.

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image4.png" %}}
*Pic 3.1.1 -- Step 1: View of Dataspecer Manager and plus button*

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image5.png" %}}
*Pic 3.1.2 -- Step 2: View of Dataspecer Manager once plus button is clicked*

Once this button is clicked the user needs to provide name and
description for the option and then click "Save Changes". Once this
process is complete, the user will be able to view the newly created
package/model in the Dataspecer manager under the desired data
specification. Each OpenAPI Specification package/model has an edit
button on the right side. Once the user clicks this button, he/she is
redirected to the extension. Please refer to Pic 3.1.3 in order to view
the newly created OpenAPI specification package/model.

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image6.png" %}}
*Pic 3.1.3 -- Step 3: newly created OpenAPI specification package/model*

## 3.2 Creation and Management of APIs -- Working Mechanisms

Now that the navigation to the extension as well as its initial input is
already considered, the actual program may be discussed. Once the user
navigates to the extension, initially he/she is presented with an empty
form. The user has to fill in following information: API title,
description, version and base URL. Next section of the form is dedicated
to the data structures and operations/methods operating on them. In
order to fill in the information about the data structures the user has
to click "Add Data Structure" button. Please refer to Pic 3.2.1 in order
to view the screenshot of the resulting display once the initial data --
title, description, version and base url are provided as well as data
structure is chosen.

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image7.png" %}}
*Pic 3.2.1*

After this step the user is able to add operations for the chosen data
structure by clicking add operations button. Once this button is clicked
a new section appears where the user has to provide information about
the operation. The section has two switches. The first switch labeled
"Association Mode" decides if the operation is for the main data
structure (chosen at the beginning) or one level below it. A concrete
example will be shown later in this section. The second switch labeled
"Manipulate a collection" decides if the operation performs a collection
of resources or a single resource manipulation. Furthermore, the user
has to provide name for the operation and its type (for instance: POST,
GET, DELETE etc.). Based on this information the program generates
suggested path which can be copied into the endpoint field as input. The
user is also able to add a comment to the operation and add a response
code to it. To sum up, following operation information is needed:

-   Whether the operation refers to the main data structure or to a data
    structure which is one level below the main one.
-   Whether the operation performs a collection of resources or a single
    resource manipulation
-   Operation name
-   Operation type
-   Endpoint (path for the operation -- in the best-case suggested path
    generated by the program)
-   Comment about the operation
-   Response code for the operation

Once this information is filled in, the user is able to either add
another operation and continue in the same manner or click "Generate
OpenAPI Specification" and view the output on the right side of the
page. Please note that once this button is clicked the configuration
(filled in information) is saved on the Dataspecer backend and the user
is able to go back to the current progress and continue from that point.

Let's consider an example of generating API specification for Tourist
destinations. According to the data specification, provided in the
beginning of this chapter, Tourist destination has following
associations and attributes:

-   **Capacity** of type integer
-   **Owner** of type human or person
-   **Contact** of type contact

If these properties are not of primitive types (are attributes), they
may be considered as data structures as well. In this case, Owner and
Contact are considered as data structures however, the schema of owner
is not defined whereas contact has following attributes and
associations:

-   **Email** of type string
-   **URL** of type string
-   **Phone** **number** of type decimal number
-   **Has contact** of type workplace which in turn has a page of type
    page

Following example will provide three kinds of operations in order to
showcase the functionality of the program. These operations are:

-   **CreateTouristDests** -- operation that creates an object of type
    tourist destination and adds to the collection (of tourist
    destinations)
-   **GetTouristDests** -- operation that retrieves a collection of
    tourist destinations
-   **CreateContact** -- operation referring to a data structure one
    level below the main data structure (Tourist destinations). This
    operation creates objects of type contact.

> Please refer to Pic 3.2.2, 3.2.3 and 3.2.4 on the next page in order
> to view the resulting display of corresponding form.

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image8.png" %}}
*Pic 3.2.2 -- Operation creating Tourist Destinations*

As one can see, Pic 3.2.2 represents the operation for creating tourist
destinations. Since tourist destination is the main data structure and
this operation is intended for it, the association switch is off.
However, since the operation represents collection manipulation -- in
particular adding a resource (in this case tourist destination) to a
collection (collection of tourist destinations) the collection switch
("Manipulate a collection") is on. Next the operation name is provided
and operation type is chosen. Please note that, if manipulate a
collection is marked on, the user gets two options in the operation type
select. These options are GET and POST. In this context, GET means
retrieving collection of resources while post represents create a
resource and adding it to a collection. If the user has collection
switch off, different options focused on manipulating a single resource,
such as deleting a specific resource, retrieving a specific resource
etc. are provided. As one can see, in case of post request the user is
also able to choose which fields have to be passed in the request body.
Next the program generates suggested path and allows the user to copy
it. The path has to be provided in the endpoint field. Furthermore, a
comment can be added to the operation for the purpose of increasing
clarity. Lastly the user chooses respective HTTP response code.

The information for the next two examples were filled in similarly.
However, there are minor differences. The next example showcases
retrieving a collection of resources. Please note that in case of GET
operation, no request body is provided. Please refer to Pic 3.2.3 in
order to view the screenshot of the resulting display.

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image9.png" %}}
*Pic 3.2.3 -- Operation retrieving collection of Tourist Destinations*

The last example demonstrates how to create operations for one level
below the main data structure. In this case contact is chosen as target
data structure. In order to be able to choose contact the association
switch ("Association Mode") has to be on. Moreover, please refer to the
updated suggested path based on the new target data structure. Please
refer to Pic 3.2.4 in order to view the screenshot of the resulting
display.

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image10.png" %}}
*Pic 3.2.4 -- Operation for creating contact (target data structure is one level below main ds)*

Now that the left side of the form is already considered, the right side
may be discussed. The right side of the page is dedicated for showcasing
the output -- generated OpenAPI specification. There are three buttons
available to the user. These buttons are:

-   **Open Swagger Editor** -- opens Swagger Editor
-   **Download JSON** -- downloads generated OpenAPI specification in
    json format
-   **Copy to Clipboard** -- simply copies generated OpenAPI
    specification

Once the user generates OpenAPI specification it would be beneficial to
copy the output by clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button and paste it
in the Swagger Editor. In this case the user is able to have a better
understanding of the generated OAS since Swagger Editor also provides
graphical representation of the output.

## 3.3 OpenAPI specification as output of the project

Now that the input of the program is already considered, output may be
discussed. As said, once the user clicks "Generate OpenAPI
Specification" button corresponding OAS is presented to the user.
Generated OAS consists of following sections/constructs:

-   **openapi** -- specifies the version of OpenAPI (3.0.0)
-   **info** -- specifies information regarding OAS, in particular: API
    title, description and version
-   **servers** -- specifies base URL for the API
-   **paths** -- specifies paths and their respective operations
    (provided by the user)
-   **components** -- represent containers for various reusable
    definitions. In the context of this projects data structure schemas
    are stored in the components section.
-   **security** -- represents the authentication methods utilized in
    the API (set to basic auth).    

Now that the structure of the output is already considered, let's have a
look at the generated OAS based on the example considered earlier (in
3.2).

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image11.png" %}}
*Pic 3.3.1- Output OAS: openapi, info and path with POST operation*

Pic 3.3.1 demonstrates how the user input is reflected in the output. As
one can see, form inputs -- API title, description as well as version
are utilized to populate the info section of generated OAS whereas base
URL provided by the user is utilized in the server's section. As for the
paths and operations, form input data related to the operations is used
for populating paths and their respective operations.

Conversely Pic 3.3.2 represents s a more interesting example. It
exemplifies how GET collection operation is represented in the OAS
output. Please note that aside from the trivial output, as seen in the
first example, the program is also able to generate query parameters
where necessary. This means that when it comes to collection retrieval,
the user is able to query the result based on the fields of chosen data
structure. Because in this case the goal is retrieving a collection (not
a single resource), the program specifies in the responses that an array
has to be returned. Please refer to 3.3.2 below in order to view the
screenshot of the resulting display.

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image12.png" %}}
*Pic 3.3.2 -- Output OAS: path with GET operation*

Third operation is related to contact data structure (which is one level
below the main data structure). It behaves in the same manner as the
first example. The program is able to detect the nesting and instead of
referencing main data structure schema, it references schema of
contact.

With all other sections thoroughly examined, the final topic to address
is the components section. Components section does not require any
direct user input from the Dataspecer extension. It relies on the data
specification and respective data structures. The program provides a
schema in OAS format considering if attribute/association is mandatory
or optional as well as whether it represents an array (collection) or a
singleton object. If data structure was not designed before OAS
generation, the program also appends a description, notifying the user
that this data structure needs to be filled in. Please refer to Pic
3.3.3 below in order to view the screenshot of resulting display of
Touristdestination schema as well as respective schemas of its
associations.

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image13.png" %}}
*Pic 3.3.3 -- Tourist Destination schema and respective schemas for its associations*

According to Pic 3.3.3 one can see clearly that object of type tourist
destination has three properties to of which are not of primitive data
types -- owner and contact. Owner represents an array of objects of type
human_or_person whereas contact represents an object of type contact.
Since no properties were defined for human_or_person its description
says that the component needs to be filled in. On the other hand,
according to the schema of contact, an object of type contacts has
emails (a collection of strings), url (string), phone numbers
(collection of numbers) as well as has_contact which also represents a
collection of objects with type workplace. The schema of workplace is
also present in the components section and follows the same manner.

# 4 Technical Overview

## 4.1 Organization

Having discussed functional and operational aspects, an essential part
of providing a comprehensive overview of the project is to consider its
technical structure. The project, located within the
**../applications/api-specification** directory, exhibits an organized
arrangement within its source code, predominantly housed within the
**src** folder. The codebase is systematically partitioned into distinct
directories -- each serving a particular purpose and fostering clarity
and maintainability.

As said, **src** directory encapsulates primary codebase including
several pivotal directories. These directories are:

-   **components** - This directory serves as a repository for imported
    components sourced from shadcn-ui. These components were selected
    because of their quality and functionality. They contribute to the
    cohesive user interface design.
-   **customComponents** -- This directory serves as a repository for
    bespoke (custom) components. The goal of these components is to
    address the distinct demands of the project. By utilizing both --
    pre-imported components from the **components** directory and
    handcrafted HTML elements, these components are equipped with
    specialized features essential for seamless form operations.
-   **Models** -- The Models directory retains TypeScript interfaces and
    types utilized extensively across the source code.
-   **Props** -- Here reside TypeScript type definitions that outline
    the properties passed to custom components.

Furthermore, there are several notable files located at the root of
**src** directory. These files are: **DataStructureFetcher.tsx,
DataTypeConverter.tsx, FormValidationSchema.tsx, OApiGenerator.tsx and
MainForm.tsx.** The interesting points of each of these files are
discussed later in this chapter -- in 4.4 Key Technical Decisions.

## 4.2 Important Dependencies

This section is dedicated to inform the reader regarding important
dependencies of the project.
The most important package installed in the project is **react hook
forms**. This library streamlines form development by simplifying form
management and validation process. Another important package installed
in the project is **react hook form validation resolver
(@hookform/resolvers)**. In particular validation with **zod** was used
in order to validate form before generating the OAS. As for the UI, the
components were imported from **shadcn ui**. Shadcn UI builds its
components on top of the **radix UI**. The next important package
utilized in the project is **pluralize**. Pluralize library was mainly
used for the purpose of generating suggested paths. However, please note
that valid plural names (words) are produced only in case of English
names. The last important package is **swr** which is a library for data
fetching. This library is used for downloading the data from Dataspecer
backend. Please refer to the list of important dependencies and their
versions below:

1.  **\@hookform/resolvers: \^3.3.4**
2.  **\@radix-ui/react-checkbox: \^1.0.4**
3.  **\@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu: \^2.0.6**
4.  **\@radix-ui/react-label: \^2.0.2**
5.  **\@radix-ui/react-select: \^2.0.0**
6.  **\@radix-ui/react-slot: \^1.0.2**
7.  **\@radix-ui/react-switch: \^1.0.3**
8.  **pluralize: \^8.0.0**
9.  **radix-ui: \^1.0.1**
10. **react: \^18.2.0**
11. **react-dom: \^18.2.0**
12. **react-hook-form: \^7.51.3**
13. **styled-components: \^6.1.8**
14. **swr: \^2.2.5**
15. **uuid: \^9.0.1**
16. **zod: \^3.23.4**

## 4.3 Build Instructions

In order to build the project, one needs to follow these steps:

1.  At first, clone the whole mono repository via **git clone ...**
2.  Please set up a local environment by creating following file:
    **.env.local**. A local environment variable called **VITE_BACKEND**
    needs to be defined within this file. The variable needs to be set
    to the backend URL (e.g. <https://backend.dataspecer.com>).
3.  To install all packages, please run **npm install** from the root of
    the repository.
4.  For building the dependencies of this application **npm run build**
    needs to be run.

Please note that it is possible to run live server with the command
**npm run dev** from this directory. However, before running the live
server, all of the necessary dependencies need to be already built.

## 4.4 Key Technical Decisions

Having discussed organization as well as important dependencies, it is
time to consider key technical decisions. As mentioned earlier, there
are several files located in the src directory that represent the key
files on which the project is based. Before moving on to them, the model
of the data structure utilized across the codebase has to be presented.
Please refer to Pic 4.4.1 in order to view the screenshot of the
corresponding representation.

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image14.png" %}}
*Pic 4.4.1 -- Representation of Model Data Structure*

Now that the general structure of data structure is already showcased, a
particular example of Tourist destination may be considered. Please
refer to Pic 4.4.2 in order to view particular example of Tourist
destination.

{{% tutorial-image "images/projects/api/image15.png" %}}
*Pic 4.4.2 -- Tourist Destination as Data Structure*

As seen on the example, Tourist destination represents the main data
structure and its attributes and associations are represented by the
fields. In case the field is of primitive type (is an attribute), its
type is specifically written in Field.type. Field "capacity" exemplifies
this approach, since it has type integer and represents an attribute. In
this case type is specified in the type field directly. However, in the
case of having an association thus not of primitive type, Field.type
contains "Object" and Field.classtype is populated with corresponding
type. Conversely, the entire representation of this multi-level data
structure is considered by populating Field.nestedFields. Please refer
to the orange arrows on the screenshot. According to this example,
contact represents an association and is a field of type not primitive
data type. Because of this, contact's type is specified as "Object" and
it's classType is specified as "contact" (as specified originally when
creating this data structure in Dataspecer tool). Moreover, contact has
several fields: email, url, phone number and has contact -- all of which
are located in the nestedFields property.

As the first point the program fetches data about data specification, in
particular about its data structures from the Dataspecer backend and
stores in a collection consisting of objects conforming to the structure
described above. The logic performing this task is located in
**DataStructureFetcher.tsx**. The URL of the current window contains the
identifier of the target data specification. Based on this id the
program fetches information regarding data structures which are
contained by the target data specification. More precisely, the iris
(identifiers) of contained data structures are fetched. Once the ids are
obtained, particular data about each data structure is fetched. Having
obtained whole data, the information is stored in an array which in turn
is then processed to get the data structures in the format which was
described above. Each data structure is divided into operations and
resources (on the Dataspecer backend). The interest of the program is
resources object. It contains following information: data structure name
as well as information regarding attributes and associations. The
information about associations is processed recursively because of the
possible multiple levels of data structure. The output of this process
is list of data structures in the aforementioned format.

Now that the fetching process is already considered, OAS generation may
be discussed. The logic regarding the OpenAPI specification generation
is located in **OApiGenerator.tsx**. Main method responsible for OAS
generation is called **generateOpenAPISpecification** which in turn
calls its helper functions. The method takes two parameters as inputs --
datastructures and userInput. Parameter datastructures contains
information which was fetched from Dataspecer backend about target data
specification. This means that this parameter represents a collection of
data structures from the target data specification in aforementioned
format. As for the userInput, this parameter represents the information
which was provided by the user via the user interface. More precisely,
userInput parameter contains information regarding API title,
description, base URL as well as operations defined for particular data
structure. The consolidation of this information makes it possible to
generate corresponding OpenAPI specification.

The generator iterates over the collection of fetched data structures
and creates corresponding components schemas. The method responsible for
creating component schemas (createComponentSchema) calls method
dedicated for creation of properties (createProperties).
CreateProperties method checks if the field is of primitive type or not.
If not then it calls createComponentSchema on the field and therefore
creates component schema for the nested data structures too. It is
important to note that the program also formats the names of the data
structures since OpenAPI format only accepts certain characters. Any
character which is not accepted by the OpenAPI standard is turned into
an underscore. What's more the program takes the detected properties
(fields) into consideration and if data structure does not have any, the
program appends following description: "TODO: Fill in the component".
Furthermore, the program appends id field of type string to each
component schema so that they each have unique identifier.

Now that the main principles of component schema generation are already
considered, paths and their respective operations may be discussed. The
generator iterates over the data structures from the user input.
Usually, each data structure contains collection of operations --
specified via the user interface. For each operation method called
**handlePathOperations** is called. This method constructs operation
objects for the particular path. Moreover, the method also considers the
type of the operation and in case the operation type is GET, query
parameters showcased in subchapter 3.3 are also generated. When it comes
to constructing operation object, dedicated method for this is --
createOperationObject which in turn calls other helper functions to
generate operation object in its full form by including corresponding
request body as well as response.

It is also important to consider the file **FormValidationSchema.tsx**.
In order for OpenAPI specification to be valid it is necessary that the
combination of operationtype (e.g GET, POST, DELETE etc.) as well as the
endpoint (path) is unique. For instance, each path may have only one GET
operation object in it. Moreover, the OpenAPI standard requires that the
name of the operation (in the OAS called operationId) is unique. Since
all of this information is provided by the user, this data is validated
in the UI. This means that the developed form does not allow user to
submit invalid data. All of this is achieved via zod library dedicated
to form validation. Please refer to Pic 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 in order to view
the screenshots of the error messages displayed to the users in case of
unsuccessful validation.

The project includes converter for data types (DataTypeConverter.tsx).
The converter adapts data structure type names from Czech language to
English. The second converter adapts English data types to the data
types which are accepted by the OpenAPI standard.

Last but not least, MainForm.tsx contains the logic of the user
interface. Two types of data are fetched. First -- the information about
data structures inside target data specification and second -- pre-saved
values of the UI form. Moreover, a very important aspect of the MainForm
component is that, upon submission of the form, not only the OpenAPI
specification is generated, but also current configuration
(user-provided information) is saved on the Dataspecer backend. This
means that the form is able to retain values and the user is able to
continue designing their API from the last checkpoint. More precisely,
because of this feature it is possible to maintain the API specification
as needed.

# Conclusion

To sum up everything that has been stated above, the project --
Expanding the Dataspecer Tool for API Creation and Management serves the
purpose of generating API specifications (in OpenAPI format) based on
the data specifications designed via the tool -- Dataspecer. Once the
first OpenAPI specification is generated the configuration (information
provided by the user) is stored which means that the user is able to go
back to their latest checkpoint and continue working on the API
specification. Expanding the capabilities of Dataspecer by including the
feature of generating and maintaining APIs introduces several notable
benefits. Firstly, it allows users to seamlessly transition from the
process of data modelling to respective API specification generation
within a unified platform (Dataspecer manager). This serves the purpose
of streamlining the development process by eliminating the manual
conversion of data schemas into API specifications. What's more since
APIs play an important role in this day and age, this feature enhances
tools relevance and utility.

While the project represents a significant advancement of the Datapecer
tool it is important to note that the extension may require ongoing
maintenance and updates so that it remains aligned with the
ever-evolving standards of the API ecosystem -- in particular new
versions of the OpenAPI standard.
