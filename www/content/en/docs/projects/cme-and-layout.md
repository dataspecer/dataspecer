# Conceptual-Model-Editor (CME) - user documentation

This document explains what features are available in CME and how, why and when to use them.
We almost exclusively focus on the functionalities developed in project. For completeness some necessary functionalities are also described.

In short the conceptual model editor allows user to create new concepts and modify or profile existing concepts.

Existing concepts could be created by us in the same project or they could be used from some vocabulary on web.

Note that concepts from the web vocabularies can not be edited. They can only be profiled.

CME behaves like classic conceptual modelling with the additional option to reuse existing vocabularies and
the concept of profiling.
