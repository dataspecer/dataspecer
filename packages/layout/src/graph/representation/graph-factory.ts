     * 1st edge - From the node in the subgraph to the subgraph.
     * 2nd edge - Either the edge straight to the node, if it doesn't lies within different subgraph, or of it does, then the next part of edge goes between the subgraphs.
     * 3rd edge - from the other subgraph to the other end of the original edge.
