## How to install

Minimal installation requires only the SHACL package and all its dependencies.

1. Clone the repository `git clone ...`
2. Install all packages by `npm install` from the root of the repository
3. Build all packages (this is necessary to build dependencies) by `npm run build` from the root of the repository.
