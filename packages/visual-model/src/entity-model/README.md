# Visual Model : Entity Model
This directory contains Visual model specific entity model implementation.
Since the initial version of Visual model has not been using the entity model, we use this to introduce and test design of next entity model design.
As a result, content of this directory should be over time distributed to other parts of the core-v2 package.
